## Instructions
Submission file is **exercise01.rb**. This file contains the most optimized and most easy to understand versions.

~~But if you want validations of all cases, you can execute "exercise01.rb" file. It's contains a function from line 45 to 51 which I rarely understand, but I made it passed all the tests.~~

When executing **exercise01.rb**, there no need no declare numbers of elements. Reaching 99 elements and thr program will return result.

For the best experience, each element you insert should be in separate line. But if you want to test inline input, that's ok!
## Case covered
- Over 99 validated elements passed in the array
- Empty input
- Not a number input
- Inline input
